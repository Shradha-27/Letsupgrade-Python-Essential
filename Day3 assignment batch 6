Assignment 1: sum of n numbers with the help of while loop

# Sum of natural numbers up to num

num = 16

if num < 0:
   print("Enter a positive number")
else:
   sum = 0
   # use while loop to iterate until zero
   while(num > 0):
       sum += num
       num -= 1
   print("The sum is", sum)

Assignment 2: take integer and find weather it is prime or not

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))  
  
if num > 1:  
   for i in range(2,num):  
       if (num % i) == 0:  
           print(num,"is not a prime number")  
           print(i,"times",num//i,"is",num)  
           break  
   else:  
       print(num,"is a prime number")  
         
else:  
   print(num,"is not a prime number")
